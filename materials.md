## Educational Course Hands-on Materials

The entire course can be easily run in Google Colab. However, if you prefer to run the notebook on your local machine, please ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies.<br/>
<br/>
The Google Colab can be downloaded at the following link:<br/>

In the 'hands_on_session' folder, you will find all three notebooks necessary to follow along with the session. Additionally, the 'Talk_short_Demo' folder contains the notebooks used by some of the speakers during their theoretical talk.
