    <p>Davide Momi is a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow affiliated with GriffLab in Toronto. Recognized for his outstanding research contributions, he has been honored with the EWCN prize and the Discovery Fund 2023 Talent Development Competition: Postdoctoral Fellowship. Davide obtained his Ph.D. from the Department of Neuroscience, Imaging, and Clinical Sciences at the University G. d'Annunzio of Chieti. During his doctoral studies, he had the opportunity to conduct research as a visiting Ph.D. student at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Harvard Medical School. Prior to his Ph.D., Davide earned a Master's degree in Neurosciences and Neuro-Psychological Rehabilitation from the University of Bologna, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Perugia. With a diverse range of expertise, Davide has extensive experience in analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data, including DWI, fMRI, and ASL. He is skilled in TMS applications, EEG data collection and analysis, quantitative structural MRI assessment, machine learning, and the development of cognitive tasks. Additionally, he has a growing passion for simulating network-level macroscale brain dynamics. Davide's primary research interest lies in predicting the propagation of TMS signals at the network level, utilizing neuroimaging and electrophysiological data. He is involved in various projects encompassing multimodal neuroimaging, non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS, TES), and whole-brain modeling. The overarching objective of his project is to advance our ability to predict TMS outcomes through the integration of computational, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological approaches.</p>

    <p>John Griffiths is an esteemed cognitive and computational neuroscientist hailing from North-West Europe. Currently serving as the director of GriffLab, he has amassed a wealth of knowledge and experience in his field. Dr. Griffiths began his academic journey by pursuing undergraduate training in psychology and philosophy at the University of Warwick. He furthered his studies in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience at the University of York, under the guidance of Professor Gary Green, and later at the University of Cambridge, where he worked with Professor Lorraine Tyler. Throughout his career, Dr. Griffiths has held various research positions, including a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Sydney School of Physics, where he collaborated with Professor Peter Robinson. He then ventured to Toronto, Canada, where he conducted research at the Rotman Research Institute with Dr. Randy McIntosh and the Krembil Research Institute with Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre. In January 2019, Dr. Griffiths joined the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) and the University of Toronto as a Scientist and Assistant Professor. With a strong technical expertise in multimodal neuroimaging data analysis, scientific computing, and numerical simulations of large-scale brain dynamics, Dr. Griffiths is an active contributor to the scientific, software development, and educational endeavors of the Virtual Brain Project. His profound contributions to the field have positioned him as a respected figure in the realm of cognitive and computational neuroscience.</p>
